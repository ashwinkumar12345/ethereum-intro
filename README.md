<a name="history"></a>
> ## History 
- Oct 31st, 2008 Bitcoin Whitepaper
"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"

- Dec, 2013 Ethereum Whitepaper
"Ethereum: The Ultimate Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform"

<a name="whatsethereum"></a>
> ## What's Ethereum?

- N/W of nodes (computers)
- Used to transfer money and store data
- Anyone can download an Ethereum client and run a node
- Each node has a complete copy of the blockchain

<a name="interfacing"></a>
> ## Interfacing with Ethereum

- For Developers: web3.js
- For Consumers: Metamask (chrome extensiomn) or Mist Browser

<a name="metamasksetup"></a>
> ## Metamask Setup

- Go to Chrome Webstore and install the Metmask plugin
- Create a username and password
- Copy your 12-word mnemonic 

<a name="ethereumnet"></a>
> ## Ethereum Networks

- Main (productions apps and where ether has value)
- Ropsten
- Kovan
- Rinkeby
- localhost
- Custom RPC

<a name="ethereumacc"></a>
> ## Ethereum Accounts

- Your account consists of your account address, your public key, and your private key
- Account address is similar to your email address
- Public and private keys together form your password
- These are hex numbers, once converted to base10 => 8 x 10^79 (incomprehensibly large, cannot be guessed)

<a name="freeether"></a>
> ## Getting 'Free' Ether on Rinkeby

- Go to faucet.rinkeby.io and follow the steps
- Ether has real value only on the main network
- Receiving ether takes a certain amount of time (around 15 to 20 seconds)

<a name="trans-object"></a>
> ## Transaction Objects

- Your account address is sent to a backend node.js server
- The server uses web3.js to create a transaction object
- The transaction object consists of:
  - nonce
  - to 
  - value
  - gasprice
  - gasLimit (startGas)
  - v
  - r
  - s

<a name="delay"></a>
> ## Reason for the 15 sec delay for Transaction to Complete

- The transaction object is sent to one node on the Ethereum N/W
- The node combines all transactions received at the same time into a list
- The node then runs some 'validation logic' (mining) which causes the delay
- Result needs to be propagated across all nodes

<a name="block"></a>
> ## Block

- Data is represented by a Hash
- Hash is a digital fingerprint of the data
- It's calculated by the proof-of-work algorithm
- Block consists of:
  - Block Number
  - Nonce
  - Data
  - Prev
  - Hash
  - MINE (readjusts the nonce to calculate a specfic hash)
 
<a name="blockchain"></a>
> ## Blockchain
  
- Series of blocks, each connected to the previous
- 'Previous hash' is the hash of the previous block
- If you need to change the data in one block, you would have to mine all subsequent blocks
- This is how a blockchain resists change

<a name="distributedblockchain"></a>
> ## Distributed Blockchain

- Peer A: Block 1 -> Block 2 ...
- Peer B: Block 1 -> Block 2 ...
- For a change to be propagated it needs to be accepted by the majority of the peers

<a name="blocktime"></a>
> ## Blocktime

- You're looking for a hash less than some number, for example, 1000
- Data + Nonce = Hash -> Base10 is this < 1000, if no, decrease 1000 to maintain blocktime at 15s
- We need to vary 1000 because the number of nodes in the blockchain is always in flux

<a name="smartcontract"></a>
> ## Smart Contract
 
 - Is an account controlled by code:
   - balance - Amount of ether this account holds
   - storage - Actual data stored in this account
   - code - Raw machine byte code for this contract

<a name="deployingasmartcontract"></a>
> ## Deploying a Smart Contract to Ethereum

- Contract source is written on your laptop
- This contract is deployed as a 'contract instance' to the Ethereum N/W

<a name="solidityprogramminglanguage"></a>
> ## Solidity Programming Language

- Written as .sol files
- Strongly typed
- Similar to Javascript

<a name="soliditycompiler"></a>
> ## Solidity Compiler

- A contract is compiled by the Solidity compiler into Bytecode and ABI (application binary interface)
- Bytecode is deployed into Ethereum 
- ABI is used for interfacing with a front-end application

<a name="remixcodeeditor"></a>
> ## Remix Code Editor

- Browser code editor used for testing smart contracts
- A sample contract is as follows:

      pragma solidity ^0.4.17
     
      //Version of the compiler
      //Contract will be valid for newer versions of Solidity
      
      contract Inbox {
      
      //Contract definition
      //Similar to class definition
      
          string public message;
          
      //string is the datatype
      //public means that the variable can be called by anyone
      //message is the name of the storage variable
      //The value of message is stored on the blockchain
      
          function Inbox(string initialMessage) public {
          
      //Inbox is a constructor function
      //Contructor function is automatically called when the contract is deployed
      //public means that the function can be called by anyone
      //Function types: public, private (only the contract can call this function), view (returns data but does not modify),
      //pure (does not return or modify data), payable (sends some ether along)
      
              message = initialMessage;
          }
          function setMessage(string newMessage) public {
              message = newMessage;
          }
      }

<a name="remix"></a>
> ## Testing with Remix

- Remix hosts an Ethereum N/W to simulate running the contract
- Click `Create (string initialMessage)`, after adding any initial message 
- Once created, click `message` to retrieve that initial message 
- Click `setMessage (string setMessage)`, after adding a new message
- Once created, click `message` to retrieve the new message

<a name="behind-the-scenes-deployment"></a>
> ## Behind-the-Scenes Deployment

- The contract creates a transaction object with the following info:
 - nonce - Number of times the sender has sent a transction
 - to - Always blank for a contract
 - data - Bytecode
 - gasPrice - Amount of ether per transaction
 - startGas - Units of Gas
 - v, r, s - Cryptographic elements - Creates public and private keys from your account address, the reverse is not possible

<a name="moreonfunctions"></a>
> ## More on Functions
 
 - Whenever we want to modify any data on the N/W, a transaction object is sent, which needs to be approved (mining)
 - Calling a function - Get operation, free, instantaneous
 - Sending a transction to a function - Modify operation, costs ether, slow

<a name="wei"></a>
> ## Wei v/s Ether

  - Wei is the smallest unit of currency
  - 1 Eth = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Wei
  - No fractional unit of Wei

<a name="gasandtransactions"></a>
> ## Gas and Transactions

 - Different operations have different gas costs
 - gasPrice - Amount of Wei per unit of gas
 - startGas - Total amount of Wei you are willing to spend (safety net)

<a name="mneomonic"></a>
> ## Mneomonic Phrase

 - 12-word phrase that allows you to generate the pub and priv key
 - 12-word menomonic -> BIP39 Algo -> Account address (Pub key and Priv key)
