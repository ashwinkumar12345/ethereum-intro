## Introduction to Ethereum

#### History 

Oct 31st, 2008 Bitcoin Whitepaper
"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"

Dec, 2013 Ethereum Whitepaper
"Ethereum: The Ultimate Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform"

#### What's Ethereum?

- N/W of nodes
- It's used to transfer money and store data
- Anyone can download an Ethereum client and run a node
- Each node has a complete copy of the blockchain

#### Interfacing with Ethereum

- For Developers: web3.js
- For Consumers: Metamask or Mist Browser

#### Metamask Setup

- Go to Chrome Webstore and install the Metmask plugin
- Create a username and password
- Copy your 12-word mnemonic 

#### Metamask N/Ws

- Main
- Ropsten
- Kovan
- Rinkeby
- localhost
- Custom RPC

#### Ethereum Accounts

- Your account consists of your account address, your public key, and your private key
- Account address is like your email address
- Public and Private keys together form your password
- These are hex numbers, once converted to base10 => x 10^79 (incomprehensibly large, cannot be guessed)

#### Getting 'free' ether on Rinkeby

- Go to faucet.rinkeby.io and follow the steps
- Ether has real value only on the main network
- Receiving ether takes a certain amount of time (around 15 to 20 seconds)

#### Transaction Object

- Your account address is sent to a backend node.js server
- The server uses web3.js to create a transaction object
- The transaction object consists of:
  - nonce
  - to 
  - value
  - gasprice
  - gasLimit (startGas)
  - v
  - r
  - s
  
#### Reason for the 15 sec delay for transaction to complete

- The transaction object is sent to one node on the Ethereum N/W
- The node combines all transaction received at the same time into a list
- The node then runs some 'validation logic' (mining) which causes the delay

#### Block

- Data is represented by a Hash
- Hash in a digital fingerprint of the data
- It's calculated by the proof-of-work alogorithm
- Block consists of:
  - Block Number
  - Nonce
  - Data
  - Prev
  - Hash
  - MINE (readjusts the nonce to calculate a specfic hash)
  
#### Blockchain
  
- Series of blocks connected in series
- Previous hash is the hash of the previous block
- If you need to change the data in one block, you would have to mine all subsequent blocks
- That's how a blockchain resists change

#### Distributed Blockchain

- Peer A: Block 1 -> Block 2 ...
- Peer B: Block 1 -> Block 2 ...
- For a change to be propagated it needs to be accepted by majority of the peers

#### Blocktime

- You're looking for a hash less than some number, for example, 1000
- Data + Nonce = Hash -> Base10 is this < 1000 if no decrease 1000 to maintain blocktime at 15s
- We need to vary 1000 because the number of nodes in the blockchain is always in flux

#### Smart Contract
 
 - Is an account controlled by code:
   - balance - Amount of ether this account holds
   - storage - Data store for this account
   - code - Raw machine byte code for this contract
  
#### Deploying a Smart Contract to Ethereum

- Contract source is written on your laptop
- The contract is deployed as a 'contract instance' to the Ethereum N/W

#### Solidity Programming Language

- Written as .sol files
- Strongly typed
- Similar to Javascript

#### Solidity Compiler

- A contract is compiled by the Solidity compiler into Bytecode and ABI
- Bytecode is deployed into Ethereum 
- ABI is used for interfacing with a front end application

#### Remix

- Browser code editor used for test smart contracts

      pragma solidity ^0.4.17
      
      //Version of the compiler
      //Contract will be valid for newer versions of Solidity
      
      contract Inbox {
      
      //Contract definition
      //Similar to class definition
      
          string public message;
          
      //string is the datatype
      //public means the variable can be called by anyone
      //message is the name of the storage variable
      //The value of message is stored on the blockchain
      
          function Inbox(string initialMessage) public {
          
      //Inbox is a constructor function
      //Contructor function is automatically called when the contract is deployed
      //public means that the function can be called by anyone
      //Function Types: public, private (only the contract can call this function), view (returns data but does not modify),
      //pure (does not return or modify data), payable (send some ether along)
      
              message = initialMessage;
          }
          function setMessage(string newMessage) public {
              message = newMessage;
          }
      }

#### Testing with Remix

- Remix hosts an Ethereum N/W to simulate running the contract
- Create (string initialMessage)
- Once created, message, setMessage (string setMessage)

#### Behind the scenes deployment

- The contract creates a transaction obj with the following info:
 - nonce - How many times a sender has sent a transction'
 - to - This always blank for a contract
 - data - Bytecode
 - gasPrice - Amount of ether per transaction
 - startGas - Units of Gas
 - v, r, s - Cryptographic elements - Creates Pub and Priv key from Acc address
 - The reverse is not possible
 
 #### More on Functions
 
 - Whenever we want to modify any data on the N/W, a trans obj is sent, which needs to be approved (mining)
 - Calling a function - Get operation, free, instantaneous
 - Sending a transction to a function - Modify operation, costs ether, slow
 
#### Wei v/s Ether

  - Smallest unit of currency
  - 1 Eth = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Wei
  - No fractional unit of Wei

#### Gas and Transactions

 - Different operations have different gas costs
 - gasPrice - Amount of Wei per unit of gas
 - startGas - Total amount of Wei you are willing to spend (safety net)
 
#### Menomonic Phrase

 - 12-word phrase that allows you to generate the pub and priv key
 - 12-word menomonic -> BIP39 Algo -> Account address (Pub key and Priv key)
